# COVID-in-Taiwan
The data of this project is as of 12/19/2021.
I decided to do this project is to remember this rough time for all people all around the world, and everyone start learning to keep an eye on public healthcare and also care for other countries. I think it's the worst time and a good time. We learn a lots from this experience and advance from time to time to deal with this kind of global crisis.
Though at the starting point of the COVID-19, Taiwan is the country with the least confirmed cases around the world. However, as the vaccination rate gradually rise up in most of the countries, Taiwan has no resources to get enough vaccine for their people. Without a doubt, without vaccination, no matter how government strives to block virus out of the country, it only can last a short amount of time.
